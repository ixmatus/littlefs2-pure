# Changelog

All notable changes to `littlefs2-pure` land here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The 0.x line is explicit about API churn; `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` lists every gap against the v1.0 surface.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Metadata pair reader (`meta::MetadataReader`).** Walks a metadata block,
  verifies every CCRC, exposes tags from successfully committed regions via
  the `iter_tags` iterator. Bit accuracy verified against the C reference's
  `lfs_dir_fetchmatch` (lfs.c:1095): big endian tag word, little endian
  revision counter and CRC body, XOR encoded against the previous tag,
  CRC reset and `(chunk & 1) << 31` parity flip on each verified commit.
- **Tag helpers.** `dsize`, `body_len`, `is_ccrc`, `ccrc_chunk` for the
  reader and the synthetic builder.
- **Synthetic metadata block builder** (`tests/common::BlockBuilder`) for
  property testing. Independent reimplementation of the commit byte layout;
  the reader + builder agreement is a cross check, not a self consistency
  invariant.
- **Property tests for the metadata reader** (`tests/property_meta.rs`):
  single commit roundtrip, multi commit roundtrip with parity alternation,
  single byte corruption invalidates the committed region.
- Workspace and package scaffold.
- `Storage` trait: read, program, erase, sync, with associated geometry consts.
- `BlockAddress`, `BlockPair` newtypes.
- LittleFS CRC32 implementation (table based, matching the C reference's nibble table) with a bit by bit reference for property cross checking.
- `Tag` type with the 32 bit on disk layout, abstract type and chunk decomposition, valid bit handling, and the full v2 type enumeration.
- `Path` type: fixed capacity (255 byte cap, matching `LFS2_NAME_MAX`), validated on construction.
- `Error` enum.
- Property tests for CRC (table vs bit by bit) and `Tag` (encode then decode is the identity).
- ADRs 0001 through 0004 establishing the pure Rust posture, the SPEC as oracle, the five verification stacks, and the offline C reference vector strategy.
- `docs/PLAN.md` documenting the phased path to v1.0.

### Not yet implemented (see `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for the full list)

- Mount and superblock detection.
- Directory traversal.
- File read and write.
- Format.
- Conformance harness and golden vectors.
- Kani harnesses (the `kani` feature compiles but contains no harnesses yet).
- Fuzz harnesses.

## Notes on 0.x

Every 0.x release is permitted to break the public API. Pin to an exact version (`= "0.1.0"`) if API stability matters during the read and write kernel implementation; switch to caret ranges (`"^1"`) once 1.0 ships.
